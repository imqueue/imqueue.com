        IMQ is an Intercommunication Messaging Queue Framework for service
        oriented back-end architectures.
    </p>
</div>

<p>There are several key capabilities:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Massaging Queue as a base communication protocol between services</li>
    <li>RPC-like programming interface</li>
    <li>Rapid application development command line interface</li>
</ul>

<p>
    These provides an ability for developers to create back-end services
    (or micro-services as a special case of SOA) very fast and focus only
    on functionality implementation without need to take care of low-level
    implementation.
</p>

<p>
    IMQ protocol takes care about providing all necessary capabilities for
    building distributed service-oriented application which are described below.
